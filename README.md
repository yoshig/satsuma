## Getting Started
To run script to sync NFTs:
```
npx ts-node-esm scripts/syncNFTsFromEvents.ts
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Next steps would be:
- Display event information related to an NFT when clicked
- Move more objects into components rather than on main page
- Add additional validation checks and improve import script
